# Melanoma

Systems-level network modeling deciphers the master regulators of phenotypic plasticity and heterogeneity in melanoma 

The code for generating all figures has been placed under the folder "Figures". 
Datasets GSE4843, GSE137391, GSE80829, GSE10916, GSE7127, CCLE, GSE81383, GSE112509, GSE134432 need to be downloaded into the "Datasets" folder. In case of multiple probes, for microarray data, average expression was considered. 

Supplementary figures for corresponding figures are included along with main figures, and saved in the same folder. 

Simulation datasets have been derived using RACIPE and are included in the "Datasets" and "Datasets/KD" folders under the names RACIPE.txt and Control.txt, respectively. 

Set working directory to Melanoma before starting. 

The subfolder Clusters contains list of sample names falling into cluster 1 for each dataset.
